## License and source

After 10 years Material Theme and derivates moved (months ago) to closed source to focus on important things like providing more support with premium versions of our themes, so we don't have to ask for contributions again.

If you have a brain but disagree with this decision, feel free to explore the 800+ forks that continue to use the old Apache license, **including the full history prior to our transition to closed source**. Keep in mind that Apache 2.0 has **conditions** (though some in the open-source community might overlook them for convenience).
